# Environmental-Imapct-Dashboard
Excited to share my latest data visualization project on Environmental Impact Analysis built with Tableau!
In this dashboard, I explored:

 ðŸ”¹ Carbon emissions Vs Recycling rates across industries and countries
 ðŸ”¹ Total Energy Usage over Time across industries
 ðŸ”¹ Total Water Consumption metrics over time
 
Key features:
 âœ… Interactive filters to explore regional impacts
 âœ… Time-series visualizations showing progress or regression
 âœ… Clear, visual storytelling for policy and business use
The goal? To empower decision-makers with actionable insights and to raise awareness of the pressing environmental challenges we face today.
